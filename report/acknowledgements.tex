This work was really enjoyable for me as it is my first step in the scientific research. I have been glad to learn it and how to work as a scientist. I am particularly thankful to my supervisor Dr.~Olivier Sauter for all his help and support. He taught me how a scientist must think and what one has to look for and understand as a scientific person.

Dr. E. Fable has also been helpful with his sawtooth package and the package-support and I thank him for it. I also would like to thank Dr. Alexander Karpushov for the ion temperature data management, Dr. B. P. Duval for his computer and psychological support, Prof. Jo Lister, F. Felici for the ASTRA-hotline, and A. Pitzschke, L. Curchod and all the PhD students for the many helps, advices and else they gave to me.
