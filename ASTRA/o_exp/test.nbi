!The first parameter gives the power injected by each beam source. 
!This quantity is usually time dependent, therefore, it is convenient 
!to set it as a variable rather than as a number. In the example (90), 
!this variable is ZRD1 = ZRD1X and its time evolution can be prescribed
!in the data file (Section 5.3.3). Similarly, the number of partial thin 
!beams 8 which represent the pencil beam is an adjustable parameter that 
!can be varied interactively (CF1 in example (90).
!
!The 9-th parameter in Table 4.31 also requires more explanations. 
!This parameter defines how the power of a fast ion is deposited in 
!the plasma:
!  = 0 no averaging (deposition at the birth point),
!  = 1 averaging with a finite orbit width,
!  = 2 averaging with zero orbit width.
!
!The last 10 parameters in Table 4.31 define the geometry of every pencil 
!beam. The neutral beam is characterized, first of all, by its ``footprint'',
!i.e. the cross-section of the beam with the plane including the major torus 
!axis and orthogonal to the beam axis projection onto the midplane. In turn, 
!the footprint represented as a rectangle is given by four parameters: the 
!rectangle center (parameter No.~11), major radii of two vertical sides 
!(parameters 12 and 13) and by the aspect ratio that is defined as ratio of 
!the rectangle height to its width. Secondly, by the inclination of the beam 
!axis with respect to the midplane (parameter No.~14), and, thirdly,9 by the 
!power distribution across the beam axis. The power distribution is described 
!by two Fortran functions, NBFHZ and NBFRY, in the vertical and in the 
!horizontal cross-sections, respectively. Each function has two free 
!parameters which are the first four parameters in the last line of example 
!(90) (or parameters 16, 17, 18, 19 in Table 4.31). Both functions are 
!included in the file AWD/sbr/nbuser.f and can be arbitrarily modified by 
!the user to prescribe any power distribution required.
!
!The NBI configuration file can either be created by the user from 
!scratch or adjusted by editing one of the files of this type provided 
!with the code. Another option is interactive creating/modification during
!the Astra run. The code enters in the interactive regime whenever
!-- the NBI configuration file does not exist,
!-- the parameter CNB1 takes a negative value,
!-- the parameter CNB1 changes its value during the run.
!In all cases, a dialog window pops up and the user can adjust all input 
!parameters for all beam sources. As before, assume that the input data file 
!is aug10000, (the full name of the file being AWD/exp/aug10000). If neither 
!aug10000.nbi nor aug.nbi exist in the directory AWD/exp/ then a new file 
!AWD/exp/aug10000.nbi will be created on exit from the dialog window. The new 
!(or modified) data file will then be used in the subsequent simulations. The 
!total number of sources is defined as the absolute value | CNB1 | . Note also 
!that if the actual number of records in the file is larger than expected due 
!to | CNB1 | then the excessive records are ignored. The opposite case and 
!CNB1 = 0 are treated as an error.
!
!The NBI routine provides the following output.
